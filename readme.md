### Progress from Milestone 2 to Milestone 1:
Since Milestone 2 required us to map out our project, all group members sat together for three hours and drew out our E/R diagram, as well as DBMS assumptions and website flow. Most of the work was done in cooperatively as these decisions decide our path going forward. 

Independently, each group member set up the skeleton code to run in their own environment.
